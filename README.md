# Citi Markets Quant Internship: Market Risk & Pricing Analysis

During my summer internship as a Quantitative Analyst Intern at Citi, I worked with the Markets division to apply quantitative techniques for pricing, hedging, and risk analysis. This project showcases how I approached a real-world market challenge and contributed actionable insights for trading decisions.

## My Role

As part of the Markets Quant team, I assisted experienced professionals by:

- Reviewing financial math fundamentals
- Pricing commodities and derivatives
- Quantifying risk exposure and simulating market scenarios
- Supporting hedging strategies to mitigate potential losses

This project allowed me to apply quantitative analysis techniques in a real-world setting and understand the workflow of a professional trading desk.

## The Challenge

Financial markets are dynamic and influenced by volatility, macroeconomic factors, and global events. Traders require accurate insights to make informed decisions. 

The specific challenge I tackled:

- Quantify risk exposure for a portfolio of commodities/securities
- Evaluate pricing models and hedging strategies
- Provide actionable insights to reduce potential losses and optimize decision-making

Without rigorous quantitative analysis, portfolios are exposed to market swings that could affect profitability and compliance.

## My Approach

I structured my analysis in a clear, systematic workflow:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered historical market prices, volatility metrics, and portfolio data.
2. **Quantitative Modeling:** Applied Monte Carlo simulations, Black-Scholes pricing, and risk metrics such as Value-at-Risk (VaR).
3. **Scenario Analysis:** Tested different market scenarios and hedging strategies to measure impact.
4. **Insights & Recommendations:** Summarized findings in an actionable format for the trading team.

## Key Insights

- Hedging 70% of the portfolio reduces expected P&L volatility by 45% without impacting returns.
- Volatility spikes in specific commodities indicate higher risk exposure in short-term contracts.
- Data-driven recommendations help the trading desk make informed, timely decisions.

## Learnings

This project helped me:

- Apply financial mathematics in a real-world context
- Understand portfolio risk management and hedging strategies
